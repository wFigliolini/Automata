# Automata Readme

This is an implementation of the project requirements from [Jay McCarthy at UMass Lowell](https://jeapostrophe.github.io/courses/2021/fall/304/course/).

Implementation will be done in C++, using Trunk Code Quality as a linter. 

This will be a collection of smaller programs to run and test various form of automata: Deterministic Finite Automata, Nondeterministic Finite Automata,
 Regular Expressions, Context Free Grammars, Push-down Automata, and Turing Machines
